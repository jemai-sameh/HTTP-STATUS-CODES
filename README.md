  The protocol that makes internet connectivity possible is the http hypertext transfer protocol, which is of two different types.

  HTTP-Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (http://www.google.com) (when not logged into gmail account)
 
  Secure HTTPS-Hyoer Text Transfer Protocol (https://www.google.com)(when signed in)
